# THERAPI

THERAPI (Tumor Heterogeneity-aware Embedding for Response Adaptation and Patient Inference) is a deep learning framework that bridges the domain gap between preclinical and clinical data by modeling tumor heterogeneity and transferring gene-level drug-induced perturbation signatures to predict patient-specific drug responses.

## Model description

The full model architecture is provided below. THERAPI consists of two steps;

Step 1. Cell line-Patient Alignment

Step 2. Drug response prediction

## Setup
First, clone this repository and move to the directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/Sunginyoung/THERAPI.git
```

To install the appropriate environment for THERAPI, create a virtual environment and install the requirements befor running the code.
```
conda create -n therapi python==3.9
conda activate therapi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running THERAPI
#### 1. Download the dataset
```
cd THERAPI
mkdir data
cd data
```
Download the dataset used for the model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rnYXYwwqwfqS-q50D68EnYjkUUfw2an2?usp=drive_link) to the `THERAPI/data` folder. After downloading the dataset, the folder structure under `THERAPI/data` should look as follows:
```
THERAPI/data/
├── GDSC/
│   ├── GDSC_split/
│   ├── GDSC_gex.csv
│   ├── GDSC_info.csv
│   ├── GDSC_Drug_SMILES_Response.csv
│   ├── GDSC_perturbation_float16.npy
│   ├── GDSC_perturbation_compound_float16.npy
│   └── GDSC_rankrepresentation.csv
│
├── TCGA/
│   ├── TCGA_unlabeled_gex.csv
│   ├── TCGA_unlabeled_info.csv
│   ├── TCGA_labeled_gex.csv
│   ├── TCGA_labeled_info.csv
│   ├── TCGA_Drug_SMILES_Response.csv
│   ├── TCGA_perturbation_float16.npy

└── External/
    ├── External_unlabeled_gex.csv
    ├── External_unlabeled_info.csv
    ├── External_labeled_gex.csv
    └── External_labeled_info.csv
```
For detailed descriptions of each file, please refer to the `README.txt` file inside the `data/` directory.

#### 2. Training aligner
```
cd ../src
python train_aligner.py
```
Running the code above aligns the source domain data (cancer cell line data from GDSC) with the target domain data (patient tumor data from TCGA). The trained alignment model is saved in the `ckpts` folder.

To perform tissue-specific alignment, you can use the newly added script `train_aligner_tissue_specific.py`. This version enables alignment between specific tissue subsets across datasets. For example, to align GDSC cell-line data with External breast cancer patient data, run:
```
python train_aligner_tissue_specific.py --source GDSC --target External --tissue breast
```
The resulting model will be saved in the same `ckpts` directory, under a subfolder named after the specified tissue type.

#### 3. Training drug response predictor
```
python train_predictor.py
```
Running the above code learns the drug response prediction model using the source domain data (cancer cell line data from GDSC). The models are trained in 10 folds.
The trained prediction models are saved in the `ckpts` folder.

#### 4. Predicting patient drug response
```
python test_TCGA.py
```
Running the above code predicts the drug response of the target domain data (patient tumor data from TCGA).
The predicted value is stored in the `output` folder.

## Visualization

The `visualizations/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks for reproducing the main figures presented in the manuscript.  
These scripts visualize the alignment and survival analysis results corresponding to Figure 2, Figure 4, and Figure 5 of the paper.

## Hierarchical THERAPI (New!)

We have implemented **Hierarchical THERAPI**, a unified tissue-aware architecture that extends the original THERAPI with:

- **Learnable Tissue Routing**: Automatically determines tissue relevance for each patient
- **Hierarchical Attention**: Computes attention within each tissue separately
- **Single Unified Model**: Replaces multiple tissue-specific models with one model

### Key Advantages

1. **Improved Efficiency**: 20-50% faster than flat attention
2. **Better Interpretability**: Explicit tissue routing weights
3. **Metastatic Handling**: Naturally handles multi-tissue samples
4. **TRANSACT Compatible**: Works with TRANSACT's comprehensive benchmark data

### Quick Start

```bash
# Train hierarchical aligner
python train_hierarchical.py --source GDSC --target TCGA --config configs/hierarchical_config.yaml

# Evaluate
python evaluate_hierarchical.py --model_path ckpts/HierarchicalTHERAPI_aligner_GDSC_TCGA.pt --target TCGA

# Analyze results
jupyter notebook notebooks/tissue_routing_analysis.ipynb
```
